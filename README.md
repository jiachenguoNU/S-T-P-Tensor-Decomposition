# S-T-P-Tensor-Decomposition
## Introduction
Space-Time-Parameter (STP) Tensor Decomposition (TD) can solve ultra-large-scale problems involving high dimensional spaces that traditional finite element method (FEM) cannot solve. This S-T-P ROM approach removes the bottleneck of FEM for only solve one space-time solution at a time and need to be run repetitively for generating parametric solution data to uncover the parametric space, which leads to unaffordable RAM costs and disk storage.
